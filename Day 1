# 100 Days Of ML Code - Day 1

### Day 1: July 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched Neural Network in 4 Minutes and recreated the example in Python 3.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitly still struggling with some of the Math concepts, but luckily my prior experience from undergrad work is kicking back in. I plan on reviewing Math concepts in Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow and settling on a larger-scale project in the next couple of days.
