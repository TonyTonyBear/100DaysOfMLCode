### Day 9: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Programmed Linear Regression Assignment in Octave. Passed Assignment with a 100%!

**Thoughts:** I did it! My mind is somewhat boggled right now but the math holds up! I would like to make another pass tomorrow sometime to apply vectorization to my code and to tackle the bonus multivariate problems.
