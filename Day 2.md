### Day 2: July 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning @ Coursera. Completed notes on supervised learning.

**Thoughts:** I feel like this is a bit of a step backwards towards getting projects off the ground, but I think it's going to be better in the long-run to really understand the fundamentals of ML so I know what I need to build for a project to work properly.
