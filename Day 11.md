### Day 11: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched videos/Took notes re: Logistic Regression Model and Multiclass Classification. Passed Review quiz on topics.

**Thoughts:** The math portion of this is starting to fry my brain a bit. I may need to step back and make sure I understand what's going on before getting into more complex work.
