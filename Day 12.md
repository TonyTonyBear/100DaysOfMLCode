### Day 12: July 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched videos/Took notes re: Solving the problem of Overfitting. Took and passed quiz on Regularization.

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to get to the point where the math is starting to make intuitive sense on its own. I'm not sure if that means I'm understanding it correctly or if I get it as long as I don't think about it too hard. Regardless, I definitely know enough now to implement some supervised learning algorithms on my own now.
